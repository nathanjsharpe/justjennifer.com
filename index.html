      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>JUST JENNIFER IS BACK!</p>

          The boss just put her foot down, and said the shoe is soon to follow
          if I don't get her page fixed!
        </p>

        <p>
          So..I have decided to put on my webmaster hat again, and I hope you
          are pleased with the result, and, if so, please tell Just-the-boss to
          keep her shoes on?!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last few years we have moved thrice... We are re-building and
          re-locating to Missouri--just a mile north of the Arkansas state
          line..as the crow (or highway 13) flies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Blue Eye we have a new home and working studio hoping to set
          permanent roots again.

          Jennie is currently in a new store she opened last January, so we are
          celebrating our first annual anniversary!
        </p>
        <p>
          Please come, take a step into the future, and visit if you are able!
          We are doing what we can for covid, so please bring a mask and come
          see Jennie's new store:

        Our NEW show schedule has been very short--NONE! We pray that we can be
        in Silver Dollar City, Lord willing, for the Fall Fesitival in 2022, but
        our schedule changes will once again be posted here on the website!

        In the midst of all the dust, Just Jim has retained the title of
        'webmaster', and we hope to have regular improvements (HaHa!) to the web
        page (with expert aid from son Nathan the web-meister!!), so please keep
        looking in!
